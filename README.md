# hand-sim

Shadow Hand unscrewing a bottle cap by finger gaiting. Built from [`PRD.md`](PRD.md), one
milestone at a time; deviations, measured numbers and open questions live in
[`NOTES.md`](NOTES.md).

Status: **M0** (scene) and **M1** (open-loop feasibility) done. M2 onwards needs a GPU box.

## Setup (Mac, CPU)

```bash
pip install mujoco playground mediapy scipy pytest
```

## Watching it

```bash
# the open-loop gait, re-simulated live in the viewer, looping
python3 scripts/squeeze_twist.py          # generate the trajectory first (~2 s)
python3 scripts/view_scene.py --play
python3 scripts/view_scene.py --play --speed 0.25     # slow motion

# the static pregrasp pose -- ctrl+drag the cap to feel the hinge friction
python3 scripts/view_scene.py

# an mp4 you can scrub or share
python3 scripts/render.py --camera all --sites
open artifacts/squeeze_twist.mp4
```

In the viewer: turn on **site** under the Rendering panel to see the fingertip and cap markers,
and **contact force** to see where the grip is acting. `[` and `]` cycle the cameras
(`front`, `cap`, `back`).

## Checking it

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -q          # 19 checks, ~3 s -- the M0 and M1 done-criteria
python3 scripts/view_scene.py --report   # scene summary, actuator limits, pregrasp geometry
```

## Changing the scene

The hand placement and the `pregrasp` keyframe are solved numerically, not hand-tuned. After any
change to the bottle or cap geometry, re-fit them:

```bash
python3 scripts/fit_pregrasp.py           # report only
python3 scripts/fit_pregrasp.py --write   # patch assets/right_hand_mjx.xml and assets/scene.xml
```

To re-check that the hand can still turn the cap, and how the gait responds to grip and sweep:

```bash
python3 scripts/squeeze_twist.py --sweep
python3 scripts/squeeze_twist.py --fingers th,ff     # the PRD's two-finger version
```
